// MARK: - Summary -
//You make variables using var and constants using let. Itâ€™s preferable to use constants as often as possible.

//Strings start and end with double quotes, but if you want them to run across multiple lines you should use three sets of double quotes.

//Integers hold whole numbers, doubles hold fractional numbers, and booleans hold true or false.

//String interpolation allows you to create strings from other variables and constants, placing their values inside your string.

//Swift uses type inference to assign each variable or constant a type, but you can provide explicit types if you want.
